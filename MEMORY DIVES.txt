MEMORY DIVES


1. BEN'S PAST
Bartender: Well, Ben, you seem like a perfect fit for the job. Almost too good of a fit, even. What aren't you telling me?

Benjamin: Alright, here's the truth: I didn't just leave the space marines. I was dismissed.

Bartender: I see. What for?

Benjamin: Overly liberal use of firearms. Folks used to call be "Big Shot" 'cause of how often I'd discharge my rifle. It's a mistake I can admit.

Bartender: So you're trigger happy, and you want me to hire you as a bouncer?

Benjam: Just give me a chance, sir. I can prove I've changed.

Bartender: Let me think it over.

Benjamin: Thank you, sir!

Vinnie: All in.

Wally: You're kidding.

Vinnie: Nope.

Wally: You're bluffing!

Vinnie: Maybe.

Wally: You're luck's been too good. You're definitely bluffing this time. Nice try. I'm all in.

Vinnie: This is an expensive game, Wally. And you already owe me from last week's game. Are you sure?

Wally: I said: I'm ALL. IN.

Vinnie: Flip.

Wally: Two kings. That gives me three of a kind.

Wally: Can it with the emotional crap, alright? Be a tough guy, tough guy.

Voice: But...

Wally: Hey, don't forget what's on the line here. You get cold feet now and your secret's out. I'll tell everybody about your past, and I'll even spill the space beans on your little pool racket too.

Voice: You're a real son of a bug, you know that?

Wally: Just get the job done. Who's your guy?

Voice: Just a guy in my neighborhood. Pretty tall, got a red tie on.

Wally: And he's listenin' to ya?

Voice: ...

Wally: Tell me straight, bucko. He's listenin' to ya?

Voice: Yeah. He'll forget everything after tonight.

Wally: Good. See you after the show.
