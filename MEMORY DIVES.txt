MEMORY DIVES


1. BEN'S PAST
Bartender: Well, Ben, you seem like a perfect fit for the job. Almost too good of a fit, even. What aren't you telling me?

Benjamin: Alright, here's the truth: I didn't just leave the space marines. I was dismissed.

Bartender: I see. What for?

Benjamin: Overly liberal use of firearms. Folks used to call be "Big Shot" 'cause of how often I'd discharge my rifle. It's a mistake I can admit.

Bartender: So you're trigger happy, and you want me to hire you as a bouncer?

Benjam: Just give me a chance, sir. I can prove I've changed.

Bartender: Let me think it over.

Benjamin: Thank you, sir!
